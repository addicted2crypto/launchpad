                                <h4 id="package">Package</h4>
                                <p>Download Template files from <b>ThemeForest</b> by going to the downloads tab and finding the <b class="notranslate">Gameon</b>.</p>
                                <p><u>Check the files contained in the package:</u></p>

                                <h4 id="assets">Assets</h4>
                                <p><u>assets/css</u><br>
                                In this folder these are all files that give style to HTML pages. Note that everything is organized and separated by function. The third party files are in the “vendor” folder and the support files in the “support” folder, while the main files are loose at the root of the css folder.</p>
                                <p>If you need to change the font families, just change the default invocation in the “style.css” file. Search for “@import”. Google provides many free fonts and installation is very easy, see more at this link: <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">https://fonts.google.com</a></p>
                                <p>If you need to create your own styles, we recommend that you create a new file called “custom.css” and relate it to your HTML file.</p>
                                <p><u>assets/js</u><br>
                                In this folder these are the JavaScript files. They are responsible for all the interaction of the HTML pages. Here it is also organized by function but you can change some things in the “main.js” file if you need to.</p>
                                <p><u>assets/fonts</u><br>
                                In this folder these are the source files, these are only responsible for formatting the icons.</p>
                                <p><u>assets/img</u><br>
                                In this folder these are all the images of the template, but they are not the same as the ones you saw in the demo. We leave the size of each image in the art so you can easily include your own images.</p>
                                <p><u>assets/videos</u><br>
                                This folder is for you to keep the videos you are going to use in the template.</p>
                                <blockquote>
                                    <p>Image and video files are copyrighted and therefore cannot be made available with the package. Therefore, you can find them on our demo page or in the sources cited on the item page. Search for “Unsplash” or “Pexels” on Google. They have many professional-grade images for free. But never include a very heavy image, try to make them smaller using an editing program or try <a href="https://compressjpeg.com/" target="_blank">https://compressjpeg.com</a></p>

                                <h4 id="icons">Icons</h4>
                                <p>This template uses icon fonts. In particular we use a library of font icons that we think contain all the essential icons with an incredibly simple and beautiful design. You can find more details here: <a href="https://simplelineicons.github.io/" target="_blank">https://simplelineicons.github.io</a></p>

                                <h4 id="php">PHP</h4>
                                <p><u>php/form.php</u><br>
                                This file is responsible for making the template send emails. The only thing you need to do is type in your email where it says “Enter the recipient’s email address here”. And translate the texts just below that, if you wish.</p>
                                <blockquote>
                                    <p>This feature of sending emails pre-configured in the template is courtesy of our team. We do not support other types of applications that send email, such as PHPMailer, etc. But if you have any questions, let us know.</p>

                                <p><u>php/recapctha.php</u><br>
                                This file connects with the Google API reCAPCTHA, you just have to enter your secret key where it says “Put your secret key here”, see in the next section how to configure reCAPCTHA.</p>

                                <h4 id="recapctha">reCAPCTHA</h4>
                                <p>reCAPTCHA helps to detect abusive traffic on your site without any user friction. It returns a score based on interactions with your site and provides more flexibility to take the appropriate actions.</p>
                                <p>Very first thing you need to do is register your website on Google reCAPTCHA. It is very simple and fast and you will do it in 2 minutes. To do this <a href="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>
                                <p>

                                <h4 id="design">Design &amp; Color</h4>
                                <p>This HTML Template uses CSS Variables. We recommend that you access <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp" target="_blank">this article</a> for more information.</p>
                                <p>Colors, Typography and Primary Buttons have a pattern defined in the file <u>assets/css/style.css</u>. You can change the colors directly in this file. However, some Demo Pages included have a personalized style. You can identify this by looking at the “Theme Settings” area between the <b>head</b> tags in the HTML files.</p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>Also note that some Demo Pages have additional CSS files.</b>
                                </p>
                                <p><u>Example:</u> The “index.html” file loads an additional CSS. This file changes the standard colors to the another, and the same goes for the other colors. You can do this to customize everything your way.</p>
                                <p>In the HTML files, you will find something like “–section-1-bg-color” between the <b>head</b> tags in the “Theme Settings” area. This helps a lot in personalizing your page, as the name of this variable already says, it is responsible for the background color of each section of the page.</p>
                                <p>All buttons in the template are styled by the “btn-bordered-white” class. To obtain a filled button with filled outlines, just use the “btn-bordered-white active” class, just as it is done in the “index.html” file.</p>
